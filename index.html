        <h1>The Magnificent Cortasaurus Rex</h1> 
        <p>The Cortasurus Rex (Better known by its scientific name-<em>Stoutus Ignoramus</em>) is a rare and elusive species of Dinosauria hailing from the early Cretaceous Era. 
        Best known for its arrogance and grating personality, the Cortasarus Rex had a unique ability to drive even the gentlest dinosaur into a fury. 
        Unfortuntely for the Cortasaurus Rex, the ability often spelled doom for the poor creature as at the sight of a Cortasaurus, any other dinosaur would immediately pursue and kill the Cortasaurus with extreme prejudice. 
        As a result, the Cortasaurus became solitary and anti-social, refusing to venture outside its lair, even in pursuit of a mate. 
        The Cortasaurus Rex is believed to have become extinct in the early Cretaceous period, but there are rumors that the Cortasaurs managed to survive to modern day and have attempted to integrate with human society. 
        According to this rumor, a Cortasaurus can be identified by its stout figure, a superiority complex, and it's unique battle cry, "You're Stupid!!!"</p>
